# HousingPrice_regression

We are challenged with tough real estate problem, sale price prediction. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we can have a prediction tool to tell agents and buyers how much they should budget for their dream property? This is age old problem, no one has been able to solve it well. Most transactions are based on agent’s experience, not data analysis. In recent years, computing chips and storage technology have advanced more than 10-fold, Data Science has become one of the new era. In this report, we will perform analysis based on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) House Price challenge.
The data set describes the sale of individual residential property in Iowa from 2006 to 2010. There are two data sets presented, both large data sets. The training data set contains final sale price, it is to be used for the modelling section and the test data set only contains explanatory variable. We will predict the sale price of the test data based on the model we have built using training data set. The training data set contains 1460 observations and 80 variables. The test data set contains 1459 observations and 79 variables (no sale price).
